## Udemy Course: How to be an Expert in the Oil & Gas Industry

# Crude oil
Crude oil is a misture of hydrocarbons (large molecules made up of hydrogen atoms attached to a backbone of carbon) that can range from almost solid to gaseous.
Crude oils are used in electronics, detergents, plastics, medicines, toiletries and synthetic fibers.
API: American Petroleum Institute.
Light oil (=> 45ยบ API gravity): easy to pump from well and is mostly used for fuel after refining.
Medium oil (~20ยบ API gravity)
Heavy oil  (<= 10ยบ API gravity): hard to pump, mostly used as heating oil after refining a smaller amounts of fuel.
Crude oil can vary from light-colourd volatile liquid to a thick, dark, black oil.
Amount of sulphur (pt: enxofre) content in the oil: Sour when >0.5 wt%, otherwise is considered Sweet.

# Natural gas
Natural gas is a combustible mixture os small-molecule hydrocarbons, ad is formed primarily of methane.
A dry gas is composed by almost pure methane and a Wet when others hydrocarbons are present.
