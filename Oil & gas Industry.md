### Oil & gas Industry
## Udemy Course: How to be an Expert in the Oil & Gas Industry

# Crude oil
Crude oil is a misture of hydrocarbons (large molecules made up of hydrogen atoms attached to a backbone of carbon) that can range from almost solid to gaseous.
Crude oils are used in electronics, detergents, plastics, medicines, toiletries and synthetic fibers.

Light oil (=> 45º API gravity): easy to pump from well and is mostly used for fuel after refining.
Medium oil (~20º API gravity)
Heavy oil  (<= 10º API gravity): hard to pump, mostly used as heating oil after refining a smaller amounts of fuel.
Crude oil can vary from light-colourd volatile liquid to a thick, dark, black oil.
Amount of sulphur (pt: enxofre) content in the oil: Sour when >0.5 wt%, otherwise is considered Sweet.

# Natural gas
Natural gas is a combustible mixture os small-molecule hydrocarbons, ad is formed primarily of methane.
A dry gas is composed by almost pure methane and a Wet when others hydrocarbons are present.

# Energy value chain

Upstream: Exploration and production
Midstream: Transportation
Downstream: Processing and distribution

# Lifecycle of an Oil & Gas Field

Exploration: Find Oil & Gas fields
Appraisal (pt: Avaliação): Surveying and obtaining information about Oil & Gas reservois in order to decide whether or not to proceed with the development of a field. 
Development: Planning phase. Assessing the production facilities and constructing the production platform.
Production: Extraction of well fluids to the surface and preparing them for use in a refinery.
Decommissioning: The and of a field when it is no longer economic for the operator to continue production.


# Therms
API: American Petroleum Institute.
OPEC: Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
IOC: International Oil Companies
NOC: National Oil Companies
OSC: OilField Services Companies (Halliburton is in this category). They provide groundwork involved in fiding and extracting oil and gas.
