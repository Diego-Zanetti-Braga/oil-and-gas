### Oil & gas Industry
## Udemy Course: How to be an Expert in the Oil & Gas Industry

# Crude oil
Crude oil is a misture of hydrocarbons (large molecules made up of hydrogen atoms attached to a backbone of carbon) that can range from almost solid to gaseous.
Crude oils are used in electronics, detergents, plastics, medicines, toiletries and synthetic fibers.

Light oil (=> 45º API gravity): easy to pump from well and is mostly used for fuel after refining.
Medium oil (~20º API gravity)
Heavy oil  (<= 10º API gravity): hard to pump, mostly used as heating oil after refining a smaller amounts of fuel.
Crude oil can vary from light-colourd volatile liquid to a thick, dark, black oil.
Amount of sulphur (pt: enxofre) content in the oil: Sour when >0.5 wt%, otherwise is considered Sweet.

# Natural gas
Natural gas is a combustible mixture os small-molecule hydrocarbons, ad is formed primarily of methane.
A dry gas is composed by almost pure methane and a Wet when others hydrocarbons are present.

# Energy value chain

Upstream: Exploration and production
Midstream: Transportation
Downstream: Processing and distribution

# Lifecycle of an Oil & Gas Field

- Exploration: Find Oil & Gas fields. It's when wildcat wells are drilled (Exploration drolling).
- Appraisal (pt: Avaliação): Surveying and obtaining information about Oil & Gas reservois in order to decide whether or not to proceed with the development of a field (Appraisal Drilling). 
- Development: Planning phase. Assessing the production facilities and constructing the production platform.
- Production: Extraction of well fluids to the surface and preparing them for use in a refinery (Production Drilling).
- Decommissioning: The and of a field when it is no longer economic for the operator to continue production.

# Seismic Surveys

Seismic data is used to compare the data to a reservoir model and try to find potencial oil and gas reserves.

# Drilling Rigs (Drilling Equipment/Platform)
- Landrig
- Fixed Platform (already in the whater)
- Jack-up rig
- Semi-submersible
- Drillship
- Tension Leg Platform

# Drilling fluid (drilling mud)

Is a fluid hat circulates through the drill string and back uo the annulus. It does the folowing purposes:
- Clean the bit and rock face, increasing the bit penetration.
- Coll the drill bit (pt: broca), extending the bit life.
- Remove drilling debris (pt: detritos), by carrying it up the annulus and out of the hole to be treated and analysed by mud engineers. 
- Exert (pt: exercer) backpressure on the formation, wich prevents hydrocarbonsfrom entering the well bore.

# Therms
API: American Petroleum Institute.
OPEC: Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
IOC: International Oil Companies
NOC: National Oil Companies
OSC: OilField Services Companies (Halliburton is in this category). They provide groundwork involved in fiding and extracting oil and gas.
